## Introduction

Estimating phylogenetic trees is crucial in many areas of evolutionary biology.
However, visualizing the relationship between data and trees is not intutive. To assist with visualizing this relationship, I have created treesiftR, 
an R package [@R] that takes subsets of data from a phylogenetic matrix, generates a tree under parsimony, and scores that tree under both the likelihood and parsimony criteria. The output of the package is a visualization or set of visualizations of a tree and characters. Also included is a [Shiny application](https://wrightaprilm.shinyapps.io/treesiftr_app/) [@shiny] that can be run locally or used via the web without installing any R packages or having knowledge of R.

### Target Audience

treesiftr has been used in the [Analytical Paleobiology Workshop](http://www.analytical.palaeobiology.de/), in which the audience was graduate students and postdocs, many of whom had no prior knowledge of phylogeny. It is also
used in the Genetics course at Southeastern Louisiana University, where the audience 
is undergraduates who have no prior knowledge of phylogeny. It is meant to be 
accompanied by lecture material on phylogenetics. A glossary is provided with each 
worksheet, and a sample slide deck is included in the `inst/slides` directory.

## Installation 

Currently, treesiftr can be installed via the devtools ```install_github```
function [@devtools]. 

```{r}
devtools::install_github("wrightaprilm/treesiftr")
```

## Required Packages

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(treesiftr)
library(phangorn)
library(alignfigR)
library(ggtree)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Operation

The first step to making a treesiftr visualization is to select the subset of 
the phylogenetic matrix that we would like to visualize. This is performed via a function called ```generate_sliding```. The below command will subset the  

```{r message=FALSE,  warning=FALSE} 
# Locate package data
```{r message=FALSE} 
fdir <- system.file("extdata", package = "treesiftr")
aln_path <- file.path(fdir, "bears_fasta.fa")
bears <- read_alignment(aln_path)
tree <- read.tree(file.path(fdir, "starting_tree.tre"))

sample_df <- generate_sliding(bears, start_char = 1, stop_char = 10, steps = 1)

# Generate our list of dataframe subsets
sample_df <- generate_sliding(bears, start_char = 1, stop_char = 5, steps = 1)
```

The result of this is a dataframe, shown below:

```{r}
sample_df
```
This dataframe dispays the start character (the first character that will be visualized) and stop character (the final character that will be visualized). 

We can then build trees from each subset:

```{r message=FALSE,  warning=FALSE}
output_vector <- generate_tree_vis(sample_df = sample_df, alignment =                                                     aln_path, tree = tree, phy_mat = bears)
output_vector
```

`Phangorn` [@Schliep2011, Schliep2017] requires a starting tree to estimate a parsimony tree. We specify the tree we read in earlier for this purpose. The trees, which were generated with `ggtree` [@ggtree], a ggplot2 [@ggplot2] library for phylogenies, have been saved to a vector, which can be displayed in its entirety, or subsetted to look at specific trees.
